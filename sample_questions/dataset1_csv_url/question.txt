Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia. It is at the URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON array of strings containing the answer.

1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?
3. What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it.
   Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."` under 100,000 bytes.



QUESTIONS:
1. From product_image.png, extract product name.
2. Look up this product in product_catalog.db and return full details.
3. From the Wikipedia URL, return the top 3 best-selling books.

USER_PROMPT = f"""
You are generating Python code that solves the given problem in multiple incremental steps.

Rules:
- You can read {folder}/metadata.txt if it exists.And pass its info to you llm call.
- Store any new insights into {folder}/metadata.txt (append).
- After each partial step, raise StepIncompleteError to continue the loop.
- Only store the final answer in {folder}/result.txt.

- External libraries must be listed; built-ins should not be listed.
- If an error occurs, raise StepIncompleteError so the controlling loop can retry or continue.
- Use the provided Gemini API key when additional reasoning or code generation is needed mid-process.

Your process:
1. Read any available metadata from metadata.txt.
2. Execute one logical step toward the solution.
3. Save findings to metadata.txt.
4. Raise StepIncompleteError until the final step is reached.
5. On the last step, store the result in result.txt and set is_correct = true.

This task will be run without human interaction; your code must handle data retrieval, LLM calls, and file operations automatically.
